# Cookify:Al-powered Cooking Application

This study examines the Cookify mobile application developed to meet modern kitchen needs. The main problem is that users can easily and effectively access various recipes. Cookify responds to this need with artificial intelligence-supported search features, personalized recipe suggestions, and features that take users' health information into account. During the development of the application, an intensive literature review was conducted on the shortcomings of existing recipe applications and how we can improve user experiences.

Cookify is powered by Algolia's artificial intelligence-powered search technology, providing users with fast and accurate search results. Recipe recommendations based on health information and community-driven comment and rating systems further improve the user experience. The results show that Cookify better understands and meets users' needs compared to similar applications. The app has proven itself as an interactive and innovative platform for cooking enthusiasts.
